# Unger's Project Euler Solution Page

Just a place to backup and store my solutions.  I'm sure that better coders and writers will have better pages but this one's mine.  Also, I understand that it's bad form to publish recently released problems but I'm way behind and slow so don't think there's a problem here.  That said, I could be wrong.  Reach out if you have other ideas or philosophies I should consider.

## Why Do Project Euler?

Solving the questions is fun, engages one's math brain and coding brain.  Just reading problems taxes my brain and is something I can only do with any focus or length of time having eaten and gotten a good night's rest.  I enjoy Project Euler to:
- Refresh and review languages I already have some familiarity with.
- Learn more about languages that I'm less familiary with.  As of 02025-01-03 this is more of a theoretical advantage in that I think that I've done most of my problem solving with Ruby.  But I've only solved 14 to date.
- Improve my coding.  It's fun to refactor my code to make it faster and/or more readable and elegant. 

## What's the Value of Euler in the Age of AI, CoPilot and modern programming languages?

It's true that AI can solve nearly every problem for you.  Indeed, Copilot on VS Code (with Vim keybindings, of course) seems itching to solve the problem within a few key strokes.  But, what's the fun in that?  There are much more productive applications of AI to coding than solving Project Euler problems.  

## How do I turn off CoPilot in VS Code?

Yeah, I have that problem, too.  CoPilot seems like an all or nothing situation there.  So, I Euler with [Vim](https://www.vim.org).  Hashtag [technical sophistication](https://www.securemac.com/news/the-securemac-interview-michael-hartl-on-technical-sophistication).  

## Should everyone know vim?

Yes.  Everyone should have at least a conversational knowledge of vim and at least basic usage (beyond :q).  There are [more articulate vim advocates](https://www.bizstream.com/blog/why-every-developer-should-learn-vim/) than I am but I'd say advantages of knowing some vim include:
- **Speed!** -- no need to move hands to use mouse or trackpad
- Universally available -- at least vi available on unix based systems
- customability 

## That's it for now.
